# Luminesence-Website
the luminesence website is a site dedicated to letting u play games during school

everyone should have access to games, even if it's during school

it also has hacks, which can be plugged into a websites inspect mode console. (F12)

everything is written in either html of javascript, so it should always run.

Also, dont tell any school admins about this.
