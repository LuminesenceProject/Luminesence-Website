# Luminesence-Website
The luminesence website is a site dedicated to letting a user play games during school.

Everyone should have access to games, even if it's during school

It also has hacks, which can be plugged into a websites inspect mode console. (F12)

Everything is written in either html of javascript, so it should always run.
