A note on performance
=====================

The performance of this game is device dependent. Though it works well in all 
relevant browsers, especially with canvas acceleration, IE not much supported 
yet it works with the game. On mobiles it works.

A note on code structure
========================

We are keeping the very ide of the original code, so it is still: "In fact, in order to
keep it simple to understand it embeds the javascript for each example directly in the HTML
page (horror!) and, even worse, uses global variables and functions (OMG!)". In the updates 
we've put touch.j separately yet most of changes are in the main files. Send a note if 
you need some help about it.
